This project is to simulate a dictionary-based 'Brute Force Attack' on an authentication page locally on your computer only.
I created this project in the second year of my degree as a mini-project for the summer training assessment.
In this project, I made a fully functional authentication page with an attack button embedded on the sign-in page.
When clicked runs a JavaScript-based code to try every password from a dictionary created by reconnaissance into the password field until authentication succeeds. 
We can also run this script with a few changes in the console to launch this attack on another web page too, for educational purposes.

To run this project on your device download the zip file and open in VS Code or any other IDE of your choice.
Install the Live Server Extention on your VS Code and open the sign_in.html page and tap on Go Live button on bottom right corner to run the project on local host.
